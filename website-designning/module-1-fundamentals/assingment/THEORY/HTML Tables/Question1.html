<!-- 
Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following
elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>.

    An HTML table is structured using the <table> element as the main container, defining rows with <tr>, header cells with <th>, and data cells with <td>. 
    The <thead> element groups the header rows, while the <tbody> element (though often implicit) groups the data rows.


    <table>:
        This tag defines the entire table and is the outermost container for all other table-related elements. 


    <tr>:
        This tag defines a single row within the table. 
        It holds the table cells (either <th> or <td>) that make up the row. 

    <th>:
        This tag represents a header cell. It's typically used for the column headers or row labels and is often displayed in a bold or emphasized font by default. 
        
    <td>:
        This tag represents a standard data cell. It holds the actual data within the table rows. 

    <thead>:
        This tag is used to group the header rows of the table. 
        It must be placed inside the <table> element, after any <caption> or <colgroup> elements, and before any <tbody>, <tfoot>, or <tr> elements
