<!-- 
Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO?
Provide examples ofsemantic elements.


Semantic HTML means using HTML elements that convey the meaning (or "semantics") of the content they wrap. 
Instead of using generic tags like <div> and <span>, semantic tags like <header>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> tell browsers, developers, and assistive technologies what the content is about.

Key points:

    It gives structure and meaning to web pages.

    Helps browsers, search engines, and screen readers interpret content better.

    Makes code more readable and maintainable for developers.

Importance for Accessibility
    Screen readers rely on semantic tags to help visually impaired users navigate a page.

    Tags like <nav> or <main> help users quickly jump to important parts without listening to the entire page.

    Proper use of headings (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) allows better hierarchy and logical flow for assistive devices.
