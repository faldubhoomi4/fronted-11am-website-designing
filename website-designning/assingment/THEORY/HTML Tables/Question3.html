Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
alternative?

Tables should be used sparingly for layout purposes because they were not designed for that role and can cause several problems in modern web development. Here’s why:

Problems with Using Tables for Layout:
Poor Accessibility: Screen readers and assistive technologies may misinterpret layout tables as data tables, confusing users with disabilities.

Complex Code: Table-based layouts often require deeply nested structures, making the HTML harder to read, maintain, and update.

Slow Rendering: Browsers must load the entire table before rendering the content, potentially slowing down page load times.

Inflexibility: Tables don't adapt well to responsive design or different screen sizes, making it hard to create mobile-friendly layouts.

Separation of Concerns Violation: Using tables for layout mixes content (HTML) with presentation, which goes against modern web standards that promote separating structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).

Better Alternative:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the modern and recommended way to handle layout. Some specific techniques include:

Flexbox: Ideal for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns).

CSS Grid: Best for two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns).

Media Queries: Allow for responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
