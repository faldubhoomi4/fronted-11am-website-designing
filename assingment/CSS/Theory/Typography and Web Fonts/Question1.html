Question 1: Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why
might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

Amswer: 

  Web-Safe Fonts:
  Definition:
  Web-safe fonts are pre-installed on most operating systems and devices. 
  They are considered "safe" because you can count on them to render the same across different browsers and platforms without needing to load them from the web.
 
    Examples:

    Arial

    Times New Roman

    Courier New

    Georgia

    Verdana

    Trebuchet MS

Pros:

    No need to load externally — improves performance.

    Consistent appearance across devices.

    Faster page load times.



Custom Web Fonts:

Custom web fonts are downloaded from the web at runtime, typically using @font-face in CSS or linking to services like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts.

    Examples:

    Roboto (Google Fonts)

    Open Sans

    Lato

    Montserrat

    Poppins

Usage Example (Google Fonts):

 <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    body {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
 }

Pros:

 Allows for unique branding and design.

 Gives more creative control over typography.


 Why Use a Web-Safe Font Over a Custom Font?
 Performance is critical: No need to load font files, so the page loads faster.

 Internet speed is limited: Users with slow connections won’t have to download large font files.

 You need guaranteed compatibility: Web-safe fonts ensure consistent rendering without relying on external sources.

 Minimal design or fallback needed: If you want to keep the site light and simple.
