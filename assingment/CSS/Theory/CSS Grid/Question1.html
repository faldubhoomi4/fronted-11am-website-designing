Question 1: Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over
Flexbox?

Answer: 


=>CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in CSS used to create two-dimensional layouts, meaning it can handle both rows and columns simultaneously.

 Basic Concept:

 A Grid Container is created using display: grid.
 Inside, you define grid tracks using properties like grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.
 You can place child elements (grid items) into specific cells using grid-row, grid-column, or the shorthand grid-area.


 Example:

 .container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; /* Three equal columns */
  grid-template-rows: auto auto;      /* Two rows */
  gap: 10px;
}

<div class="container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>


Flexbox vs. Grid: Key Differences: 

 Flexbox:

 =>Axis Support:One-dimensional (row OR column)
 =>Layout Control:Ideal for content flow and alignment
 =>Item Placement: Sequential, flow-based
 =>Use Case: Menus, nav bars, single-axis layouts

 CSS Grid:

 =>Axis Support: Two-dimensional (row AND column)
 =>Layout Control: Ideal for structured, grid-based layouts
 =>Item Placement:	Explicit row/column placement possible
 =>Use Case: Complex layouts, dashboards, full pages


 When to Use Grid Over Flexbox: 

 => You need a layout with rows and columns.
 => You're designing a page layout (e.g., header, sidebar, main content, footer).
 => You want to control precise placement of items in a grid.


 Use Flexbox when:

 => You're aligning items in a single row or column.
 => You're distributing space dynamically among items.
 => You need content to wrap or grow/shrink fluidly in one direction.
