Question 1: What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms
flex-container and flex-item.
Answer: 

CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model in CSS that allows you to design complex and responsive layouts more easily and efficiently. 
It is especially useful when you need to align items in a row or column and distribute space within a containerâ€”even when the size of the items is unknown or dynamic.


=>  Why Flexbox is Useful for Layout Design


One-dimensional layout: Flexbox handles layout in either row or column direction, not both simultaneously (unlike CSS Grid).

Responsive design: It easily adapts to various screen sizes.

Efficient alignment: Align items both horizontally and vertically with minimal code.

Space distribution: Distributes available space among items and handles gaps effectively.

Ordering items: Allows reordering of items visually without changing the HTML structure.


=>  Flex Container

Example: 

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
}

Properties for Flex Container:

flex-direction: Defines direction of items (row, column, etc.)

justify-content: Aligns items horizontally

align-items: Aligns items vertically

flex-wrap: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines

=>   Flex Item


The child elements inside the flex container that are laid out using Flexbox rules.

Example: 

<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
</div>


Properties for Flex Items:

flex-grow: Defines how much an item will grow relative to others

flex-shrink: Defines how items shrink when necessary

flex-basis: Sets the initial size of an item

align-self: Overrides align-items for a specific item

order: Changes the order of items visually

Example:  
<style>
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }

  .flex-item {
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    width: 100px;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>

<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="flex-item">1</div>
  <div class="flex-item">2</div>
  <div class="flex-item">3</div>
</div>
