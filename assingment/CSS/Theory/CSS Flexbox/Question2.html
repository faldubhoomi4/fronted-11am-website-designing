Question 2: Describe the properties justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction used
inFlexbox.
Answer: 

justify-content:

Purpose:
Aligns flex items along the main axis of the flex container. 


Values:
flex-start: Items are packed toward the start of the container. 
flex-end: Items are packed toward the end of the container. 
center: Items are centered along the main axis. 
space-between: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end. 
space-around: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them. 
space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed with equal space between them. 

Example: If flex-direction is row, justify-content will align items horizontally. 

 
align-items:

Purpose: 
Aligns flex items along the cross axis of the flex container.

Values:

flex-start: Items are aligned to the top of the container (if flex-direction is row). 
flex-end: Items are aligned to the bottom of the container (if flex-direction is row). 
center: Items are vertically centered (if flex-direction is row). 
baseline: Items are aligned such that their baselines align. 
stretch: Items are stretched to fill the container along the cross axis. 

Example: If flex-direction is row, align-items will align items vertically. 

flex-direction:

Purpose:
Defines the direction of the main axis, which in turn determines the direction that justify-content and align-items will operate on.
Values:

Values:
row: Items are placed horizontally from left to right (default).
row-reverse: Items are placed horizontally from right to left.
column: Items are  placed vertically from top to bottom.
column-reverse: Items are placed vertically from bottom to top.


Example:

Setting flex-direction to column will make the main axis vertical, and justify-content will then align items vertically, while align-items will align them horizontally.
