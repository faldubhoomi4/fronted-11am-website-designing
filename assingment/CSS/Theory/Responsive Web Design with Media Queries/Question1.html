Question 1: What are media queries in CSS, and why are they important for responsive design?
Answer: 
Media queries in CSS are a feature that allow you to apply styles conditionally based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen width, height, resolution, or device type. 
They are a cornerstone of responsive web design, ensuring websites look and function well across a variety of devices â€” from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.

 Syntax of Media Queries:

 @media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

 Common Media Features:
 width:  Width of the viewport
 height: Height of the viewport
 max-width: Maximum width for applying styles
 min-width: Minimum width for applying styles
 orientation: Landscape or portrait mode
 resolution: Screen resolution
 hover: Whether the device supports hover



 Why Media Queries Are Important for Responsive Design:

=> Device Adaptability
Allow your website layout to adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
=>Improved User Experience
Ensures readability, usability, and navigation are optimized for all devices. 
=>Performance Optimization
Load only necessary styles for specific devices, improving performance.
=>Accessibility
Enhances accessibility by making content easier to read and interact with on smaller screens.
=>Future-Proofing
Allows your design to remain functional as new devices with varying screen sizes emerge.

Example: 

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

/* For smaller devices (phones) */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
