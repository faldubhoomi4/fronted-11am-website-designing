 Question 2: Write a basic media query that adjusts the font size of a webpage for screens
 smaller than 600px. 
 
 Answer:
Here's a basic media query in CSS that adjusts the font size of the entire webpage for screens smaller than 600px:

@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
Explanation:
@media (max-width: 600px) targets screens that are 600 pixels wide or less.

Inside the block, body { font-size: 14px; } sets the font size to 14px, which is typically smaller and better suited for smaller screens like mobile devices.
