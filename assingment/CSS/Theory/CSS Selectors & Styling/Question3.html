Question 3: What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Answer: 

=>  CSS can be applied to HTML in three main ways: internal, external, and inline. 
Each has its own use case, advantages, and disadvantages.

1. Inline CSS

Definition: CSS styles are written directly within an HTML element using the style attribute.

Example:

=> <p style="color: red; font-size: 18px;">This is inline CSS.</p>


Advantages:

=> Quick and easy for small changes.

=> verrides other styles due to high specificity.

Disadvantages:

=> Not reusable.

=> Makes HTML cluttered and harder to maintain.

=> Poor separation of content and style.

2. Internal CSS

=> Definition: CSS styles are written inside a <style> tag within the <head> section of an HTML document.

Example:
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>


Advantages:

=>  Useful for styling a single page.

=>  Keeps styles centralized for one document.

Disadvantages:

=>  Not reusable across multiple pages.

=>  Increases page load time if used excessively.


3. External CSS
Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.

Example:

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

styles.css

p {
  color: blue;
}


Advantages:

=> Reusable across multiple pages.

=>  Cleaner HTML structure.

=>  Faster loading after first page (cached by browser).

Disadvantages:

=>  Requires an extra HTTP request.

=>  Doesnâ€™t work if the CSS file fails to load.
