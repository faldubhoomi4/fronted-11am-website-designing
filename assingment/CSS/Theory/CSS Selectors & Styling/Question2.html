Question 2.  Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple styles
get resolved?

Answer: 

=>
CSS specificity is a set of rules that determines which CSS rule is applied to an element when there are conflicting styles from different selectors.

When multiple styles target the same element, the browser uses specificity to decide which style wins.

=>

How Specificity Works:
Each selector is assigned a specificity value based on the types of selectors used:

Selector Type	Specificity Value
Inline styles	1000
ID selectors (#id)	100
Class selectors (.class), attribute selectors ([type]), and pseudo-classes (:hover)	10
Element selectors (div, p, h1, etc.) and pseudo-elements (::before)	1
Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~), and inherited styles	0


p {
  color: blue;
}


.text {
  color: green;
}

#main {
  color: red;
}


<p id="main" class="text" style="color: orange;">Hello</p>


How Conflicts Are Resolved:
Higher specificity wins.

If specificity is the same, the last declared rule in the CSS wins (source order).

!important overrides all, but should be used sparingly.
