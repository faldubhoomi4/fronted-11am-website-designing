<!-- 
Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.
When should each be used? 


    GET method is use to send the less sensitive data whereas POST method is use to send the sensitive data. 
    Using the POST method you can send large amount of data compared to GET method. 
    Data sent by GET method is visible in browser header bar whereas data send by POST method is invisible.

    
When to use GET:
    When you want to retrieve data, like searching for items in a catalog.
    When the request needs to be bookmarked or cached.
    When you are not dealing with sensitive data. 


When to use POST:
    When you are submitting a form with sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card information).
    When you are creating a new resource (e.g., submitting a new user registration).
    When you are modifying existing data.
    When you are uploading files.
