Question 2: What are the additional tags used in HTML5?

Answer:  

=>HTML5 introduced several new semantic, media, and form-related tags that were not present in previous versions of HTML. 
These tags make the code more meaningful, accessible, and easier to maintain.

 Semantic Tags (Structure and Meaning)
 
These tags define the structure of the web page more clearly:

<header> – Defines the header section of a document or section.

<footer> – Defines the footer section.

<nav> – Represents a navigation menu/links.

<article> – Represents a self-contained piece of content (e.g., blog post).

<section> – Defines a section in a document (like chapters or tabbed content).

<aside> – Content that is tangentially related to the content around it (e.g., sidebars).

<main> – Represents the main content of the document.

<figure> – Groups media content with a caption.

Media Tags:  

<audio> – Embeds sound/audio files.

<video> – Embeds video content.

<source> – Specifies multiple media resources for <audio> or <video>.
