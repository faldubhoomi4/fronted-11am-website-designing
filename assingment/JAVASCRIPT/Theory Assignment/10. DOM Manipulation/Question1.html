<!-- Question 1: What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript
interact with the DOM? 
Answer: 

    The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. 
    It represents the HTML or XML page as a tree structure where each node is an object representing
    a part of the document.

    The DOM allows developers to access, modify, add, or remove elements and content in the web page dynamically.

    Think of the DOM as a live map of your webpage: whenever you change it with JavaScript, 
    the web page updates immediately without needing to reload.

 Example of DOM Structure:
        <html>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
    </html>


 How JavaScript Interacts with the DOM
    JavaScript uses the DOM API (methods and properties) to:

    Select elements

    Manipulate content

    Change styles

    Handle events (like clicks, form submissions)

    Create or delete elements dynamically.


    Common DOM Methods in JavaScript:

    Purpose	Methods/Examples
    Select Elements	                getElementById(), querySelector(), getElementsByClassName()
    Change Content	                element.textContent, element.innerHTML
    Change Style	                element.style.color = "red"
    Create Elements	                document.createElement(), appendChild()
    Handle Events	                element.addEventListener('click', function)


    Example:


        <p id="demo">Old Text</p>
        <button onclick="changeText()">Click Me</button>

        <script>
        function changeText() {
            document.getElementById("demo").textContent = "New Text!";
        }
        </script>


 Summary:
    The DOM connects your HTML with JavaScript.

    It lets you make webpages interactive (change content, styles, respond to clicks).

    JavaScript reads and writes to the DOM in real-time, making modern web applications dynamic.
