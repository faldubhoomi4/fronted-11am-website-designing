Answer: 
What is an Array in JavaScript?
    In JavaScript, an array is a special type of object used to store multiple values in a single variable. 
    Arrays can hold elements of any data type (numbers, strings, objects, even other arrays), and they are ordered collections 
    — each element has an index starting from 0.

How to Declare and Initialize an Array

    1. Using Square Brackets [] (Most Common Way):
        // Declaration and Initialization
        let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
        console.log(fruits); 
        // Output: ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"]

    2. Using the new Array() Constructor:

        let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
        console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    Note: This method is less common because it can cause confusion when used with a single number 
    (it creates an empty array of that length).

    Example:

        let emptyArray = new Array(5);
        console.log(emptyArray); // Output: [ <5 empty items> 


     Example of Mixed Data Types in an Array

        let mixed = [1, "hello", true, null];
        console.log(mixed);  // Output: [1, "hello", true, null]

Summary:
Feature	            Description:
Indexing	        Arrays are zero-indexed (first element at index 0).
Mutable	            You can add/remove elements after creation.
Flexible	        Can store different data types in one array.
Length Property	    Use .length to get the number of elements.
