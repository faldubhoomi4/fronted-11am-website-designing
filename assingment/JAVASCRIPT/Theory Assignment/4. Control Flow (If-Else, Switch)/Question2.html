switch statement instead of if-else? 

Answer: 
What is a switch Statement in JavaScript?
    A switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
    It compares the value of a variable or expression against multiple cases, and executes the matching case.

     Syntax:
    switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block
        break;  
    case value2:
        // code block
        break;
    default:
        // code block

 How it Works:
    The expression is evaluated once.

    It is then compared with each case value.

    If a match is found, the corresponding code block runs.

    The break statement stops the switch from continuing to the next case.

    The default block runs if no case matches (like else).

let day = 3;
let dayName;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = "Thursday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Invalid Day";
}

console.log(dayName);  // Output: Wednesday
 
 When to Use switch vs if-else:
  
    Multiple values for one variable:	Use switch (simpler, cleaner)
    Complex range comparisons or multiple conditions:	Use if-else (more flexible)
    Few conditions:	if-else is fine
    Many fixed values (e.g., days, options)	switch improves readability

    Use switch for multiple discrete cases (cleaner code).

    Use if-else for range checking or complex logic.
