<!-- Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work with an
example.

Answer:

What is control flow in JavaScript?
    Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the code is executed. 
    By default, JavaScript runs code from top to bottom, line by line (sequential flow).
    However, using control flow statements, you can change this order, making your code make decisions,
    repeat actions, or skip certain lines based on certain conditions.


Explain how if-else statements work with an
example: 

The if-else statement is used to make decisions in JavaScript. 
It allows your program to execute certain blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.


if (condition) {
    // code block executes if condition is true
} else {
    // code block executes if condition is false
}



let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
    console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}


The condition age >= 18 checks if the person's age is 18 or older.

If it is true, it prints: ✅ You are eligible to vote.

If it is false, it prints: ❌ You are not eligible to vote.


 Optional: if-else if-else Ladder:

 let marks = 75;

if (marks >= 90) {
    console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (marks >= 75) {
    console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (marks >= 50) {
    console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
    console.log("Grade: Fail");
}


Keyword	Purpose: 
if : 	Runs code block if condition is true
else if	:  Checks another condition if previous is false
else : 	Runs code block if none of the above conditions are true
