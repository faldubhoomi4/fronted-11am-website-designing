Answer: 
   Why Error Handling is Important in JavaScript Applications:
  1.  Prevents Application Crashes
    Without error handling, a small mistake (like a typo or missing variable) can crash your entire application. Error handling ensures your program doesn't stop running unexpectedly.

  2. Improves User Experience
    Good error handling shows friendly error messages to users instead of confusing browser errors, making the application feel more professional and reliable.

  3. Helps with Debugging
    By catching and logging errors, developers can easily trace what went wrong and fix bugs faster during development.

  4. Ensures Smooth Program Flow
    Even if one part of the code fails, error handling allows the rest of the program to continue running normally.

  5. Handles Unpredictable Scenarios
    External factors (like network failures, invalid user input, or API errors) can cause issues. Error handling prepares your application to manage these gracefully.
