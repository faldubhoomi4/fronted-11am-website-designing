Answer: 
What is Error Handling in JavaScript?
    Error handling in JavaScript is a way to manage and respond to errors that occur during code execution. 
    Without error handling, your script might stop running when an error occurs. JavaScript provides try, catch,
    and finally blocks to handle errors gracefully, so your program can continue running or display a useful message. 

Explanation of try, catch, and finally:

    try block: Code that may cause an error is placed inside the try block.

    catch block: If an error occurs in the try block, it is "caught" in the catch block, where you can handle it.

    finally block (optional): This block runs always, whether an error occurs or not. 
    It is used for cleanup operations like closing files, stopping loaders, etc.


Example:

    try {
        console.log("Starting code...");
        
        // Intentionally causing an error
        let result = 10 / 0;
        console.log(result);

        // Accessing undefined variable (this will cause error)
        console.log(myVariable); 
    } catch (error) {
        console.log("An error occurred:", error.message);
    } finally {
        console.log("This block always runs, regardless of errors.");
    }

    console.log("Program continues...");


    Output:

        Starting code...
        Infinity
        An error occurred: myVariable is not defined
        This block always runs, regardless of errors.
        Program continues...


            try → Runs your code.

        catch → Catches and handles errors.

        finally → Always runs (for cleanup), no matter what.

        This helps prevent the program from crashing and makes your code more robust.
