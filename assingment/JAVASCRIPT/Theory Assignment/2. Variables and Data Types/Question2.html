<!-- Question 2: Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each.
Answer: 
JavaScript utilizes various data types to represent different kinds of values. 
These are broadly categorized into primitive and non-primitive (object) types.

1. Primitive Data Types:
2. Non-Primitive Data Type (Object):


1. Primitive Data Types:
  Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
  let age = 30; // Integer
  let price = 19.99; // Floating-point
  
  String: Represents textual data, enclosed in single quotes, double quotes, or backticks (template literals).
  let name = "Alice"; // Double quotes
  let greeting = 'Hello, world!'; // Single quotes
  let message = `My name is ${name}.`; // Template literal
  
  Boolean: Represents a logical entity with only two possible values: true or false.Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value. 
  let isActive = true;
  let hasPermission = false;
  
  Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value. 
  let city; // Value is undefined
  
  Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's a primitive value, though typeof null returns "object".
    JavaScript
  let user = null; // Represents no user
  
  Symbol: (Introduced in ES6) Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as an identifier for object properties to avoid name collisions.
  const id = Symbol('uniqueId');
  
  BigInt: (Introduced in ES2020) Represents integers of arbitrary precision, capable of storing numbers larger than the maximum value for a standard Number.
  const bigNumber = 9007199254740991n; // The 'n' suffix denotes a BigInt


Non-Primitive Data Type (Object):
  Object: A complex data type that can store collections of data and more complex entities. 
  This includes arrays, functions, and plain objects.


   // Plain Object
    let person = {
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        age: 25
    };

    // Array (a special type of object)
    let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

    // Function (a special type of object)
    function greet() {
        console.log("Hello!");
    }
