Question 3: What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript
Answer: 
In JavaScript, both undefined and null represent the absence of a value, but they signify different types of absence:


undefined: 
    This indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. 
    It can also represent the absence of a return value from a function or a non-existent object property. 
    undefined is automatically assigned by JavaScript in these scenarios.

    Example: 
    let myVariable; // myVariable is undefined
    console.log(myVariable); // Output: undefined

    function noReturnValue() {
        // No return statement
    }
    console.log(noReturnValue()); // Output: undefined

    const myObject = {};
    console.log(myObject.nonExistentProperty); // Output: undefined

null: This represents an intentional absence of any object value. 
      It is a primitive value that must be explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it currently holds no meaningful value.

    Example: 
        let myValue = null; // myValue is explicitly set to null
        console.log(myValue); // Output: null

        let user = { name: "Alice", email: null }; // email intentionally has no value
        console.log(user.email); // Output: null

Key Differences Summarized:
    Origin:
    undefined is often assigned by JavaScript automatically, while null is explicitly assigned by the developer.
    
    Meaning:
    undefined suggests a value is missing or not yet defined, whereas null signifies an intentional absence or empty value.
    
    Typeof Operator:
    typeof undefined returns "undefined", while typeof null returns "object" (which is a historical quirk in JavaScript).
    
    Equality:
    null == undefined evaluates to true (loose equality), but null === undefined evaluates to false (strict equality), as their types differ.
