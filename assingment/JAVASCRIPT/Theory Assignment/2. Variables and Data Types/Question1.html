<!-- Question 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let,
and const? 

Answer: 

    In JavaScript, variables are containers used to store data values (like numbers, strings, arrays, objects, etc.). 
    They allow you to reuse and manipulate data in your program.
    
    Think of a variable like a label attached to a value.
    You can use this label (variable name) to access or modify the value later.


     Declaring Variables in JavaScript: 

     JavaScript provides three main ways to declare variables:

        var (old way)

        let (modern way)

        const (modern way for constants)
     

    1. var:

    Function-scoped (limited to function, not block).

    Can be redeclared and updated.

    Hoisted (moved to the top of its scope and initialized with undefined).

        Example:
        var name = "John";
        name = "Doe"; // ✅ allowed
        var name = "Smith"; // ✅ allowed

    2. let:
    
    Block-scoped (limited to {} blocks like loops, if statements).

    Can be updated, but not redeclared in the same scope.

    Hoisted but not initialized (you get a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration).

    Example: 

    let age = 25;
    age = 30; // ✅ allowed
    // let age = 35; ❌ Error if in same block.

    3.const

    Block-scoped like let.

    Cannot be updated or redeclared (value stays constant).

    Must be initialized when declared.

    For objects/arrays, the reference cannot change but contents can be modified.

    Example: 

    const PI = 3.14;
    
    // PI = 3.141 ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable

    const person = { name: "John" };
    person.name = "Doe"; // ✅ allowed (object properties can change)
