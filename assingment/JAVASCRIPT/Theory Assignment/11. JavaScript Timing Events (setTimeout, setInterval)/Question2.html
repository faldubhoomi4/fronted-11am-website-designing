  ANSWER: 
  The setTimeout() function in JavaScript is used to execute a function or a piece of code after a specified delay. 
  The delay is provided in milliseconds.
  Here is an example demonstrating how to use setTimeout() to delay an action by 2 seconds:

    console.log("Action initiated. Waiting for 2 seconds...");

    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("This action is executed after a 2-second delay.");
    }, 2000); // 2000 milliseconds equals 2 seconds


    console.log("Action initiated. Waiting for 2 seconds..."); is executed immediately.
    setTimeout() is called with two arguments:
    An arrow function () => { console.log("This action is executed after a 2-second delay."); }. 
    This is the code that will be executed after the delay.
    2000: This is the delay in milliseconds. Since 1000 milliseconds equals 1 second,
     2000 milliseconds equals 2 seconds.
    As a result, the message "This action is executed after a 2-second delay." will appear in the console approximately 2 seconds after "Action initiated.
    Waiting for 2 seconds..." is displayed.
