<!-- Question 1: What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays? 
 Answer: 

 In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key (also called a property) maps to a value.
 Values can be of any type—numbers, strings, arrays, functions, or even other objects.

 Basic Example:

    let person = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        isStudent: false
    };
    console.log(person.name);  // Output: John

How to Create an Object

    Using curly braces {} (object literal):
    let car = { brand: "Toyota", model: "Corolla", year: 2021 };

Using new Object():

    let user = new Object();
    user.name = "Alice";

 Difference Between Objects and Arrays

Feature                     	 Object	                                        Array
Purpose                 Stores key-value pairs (unordered).	        Stores ordered list of values (indexed).
Access By	            Keys (properties): obj.key	                Index numbers: arr[0]
Best Use Case	        When data has named properties.	            when data is a list of items.
Syntax	                Curly braces { key: value }	                Square brackets [value1, value2]
Iteration	            for...in loop or Object.keys().	            for, for...of, .map(), etc.
Example	                { name: "John", age: 25 }	                [ "John", "Jane", "Bob" ]

 Quick Example Comparison:

    let student = { name: "Sara", grade: "A" };
    console.log(student.name);  // Output: Sara

    // Array Example
    let marks = [85, 90, 78];
    console.log(marks[0]);  // Output: 85

 Summary:
    Use objects for data with named properties.

    Use arrays for ordered collections of data.
