<!--Question 1: What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples.
o Arithmetic operators
o Assignment operators
o Comparison operators
o Logical operators


Answer: 


JavaScript offers various types of operators to perform different operations. 
The following are explanations and examples of the specified operator types:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
These operators perform mathematical calculations on numerical values.

let a = 10;
let b = 5;

let sum = a + b;       // Addition: 15
let difference = a - b;  // Subtraction: 5
let product = a * b;   // Multiplication: 50
let quotient = a / b;    // Division: 2
let remainder = a % b; // Modulus (remainder of division): 0
let exponent = a ** 2; // Exponentiation (a to the power of 2): 100


2. Assignment Operators:
These operators assign values to variables, often combining an arithmetic operation with assignment.

let x = 10;

x += 5;  // Equivalent to x = x + 5; x is now 15
x -= 3;  // Equivalent to x = x - 3; x is now 12
x *= 2;  // Equivalent to x = x * 2; x is now 24
x /= 4;  // Equivalent to x = x / 4; x is now 6
x %= 5;  // Equivalent to x = x % 5; x is now 1


3. Comparison Operators:
These operators compare two values and return a boolean result (true or false). 

let p = 10;
let q = 5;

console.log(p == q);   // Equal to (checks value only): false
console.log(p === q);  // Strict equal to (checks value and type): false
console.log(p != q);   // Not equal to (checks value only): true
console.log(p !== q);  // Strict not equal to (checks value and type): true
console.log(p > q);    // Greater than: true
console.log(p < q);    // Less than: false
console.log(p >= q);   // Greater than or equal to: true
console.log(p <= q);   // Less than or equal to: false

4. Logical Operators:
These operators combine or manipulate boolean expressions.
Logical operators combine or negate boolean expressions, returning true or false. 
They are often used in conditional statements. 
The main logical operators are && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT)


let age = 25;
let hasLicense = true;

// Logical AND (&&)
if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
  console.log("Eligible to drive"); // This will be executed
}

// Logical OR (||)
if (age < 18 || !hasLicense) {
  console.log("Not eligible to drive without a guardian");
}
