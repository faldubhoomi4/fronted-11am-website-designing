Question 1: What is JavaScript? Explain the role of JavaScript in web development.
Answer: 
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive effects on web pages.
It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

Key characteristics of JavaScript:

Client-side language: Runs in the browser.

Lightweight and versatile.

Event-driven and asynchronous capabilities.

Supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles.


Role of JavaScript in Web Development
JavaScript plays a crucial role in enhancing the functionality and interactivity of websites. Here's how:

1. Interactivity
JavaScript allows developers to make web pages interactive:

Handling user inputs (forms, buttons)

Validating form data before submission

Creating image sliders, carousels, dropdowns, etc.

2. DOM Manipulation
JavaScript can dynamically change the content and structure of a web page using the DOM (Document Object Model):

Add/remove HTML elements

Modify styles or content based on events.

3. Client-Side Scripting
It runs directly in the browser without needing server interaction for many tasks:

Real-time input validation

Instant UI feedback (e.g., changing colors on hover or click)

4. Asynchronous Communication (AJAX)
JavaScript enables fetching data from a server without reloading the page:

Used in real-time applications like chat apps, social feeds, or auto-suggest search bars

5. Event Handling
JavaScript responds to user events (clicks, keypresses, mouse movements) to make the page interactive and responsive.

6. Building Web Applications
With modern libraries/frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue), JavaScript powers full-scale Single Page Applications (SPAs).

7. Back-End Development
Using environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming.
