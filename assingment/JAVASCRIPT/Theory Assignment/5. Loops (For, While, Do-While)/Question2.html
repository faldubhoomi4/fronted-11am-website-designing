 Difference Between while and do-while Loops in JavaScript:
 Answer: 

Feature	                                  while Loop	                               do-while Loop
Condition Check	        Checks the condition before running the loop body.  Checks the condition after running the loop body.
                
Execution Guarantee	    The loop body may not execute at all if the 	     The loop body executes at least once even if 
                        condition is false.                                  the condition is false.
                
Syntax	                Starts with while (condition)	                    Starts with do { } while (condition)

while Loop Example:

    let i = 0;

    while (i < 3) {
        console.log("while loop count:", i);
        i++;
    }

✅ Condition checked before each iteration.

✅ If i starts at 5, the loop will not run.

do-while Loop Example:

    let j = 0;

    do {
        console.log("do-while loop count:", j);
        j++;
    } while (j < 3);
    // Output: 0, 1, 2


✅ Condition checked after each iteration.

✅ Code always runs at least once, even if condition fails immediately.

Loop Type	        Condition Check	        Runs at least once?	              Use When…
while	            Before loop	            ❌ No	                        You may skip the loop completely.
do-while	        After loop	            ✅ Yes	                        You must run the loop once.
