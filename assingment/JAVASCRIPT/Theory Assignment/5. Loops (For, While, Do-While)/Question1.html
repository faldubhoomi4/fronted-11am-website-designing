<!--  Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide a
basic example of each.


avaScript provides several types of loops to execute a block of code repeatedly. 
The most common types are for, while, and do-while.


1. for Loop:
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance. 
It consists of three optional expressions: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement. 

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("For loop iteration:", i);
}

In this example:
let i = 0: Initializes the counter variable i to 0.
i < 5: The loop continues as long as i is less than 5.
i++: Increments i by 1 after each iteration.


2. while Loop:
The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. 
The condition is checked before each iteration. 

let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
  console.log("While loop iteration:", count);
  count++;
}

In this example:
let count = 0: Initializes count to 0.
count < 3: The loop continues as long as count is less than 3.
count++: Increments count inside the loop to ensure the condition eventually becomes false.


3. do-while Loop:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false. 
The condition is checked after the first iteratio


let x = 5;
do {
  console.log("Do-while loop iteration:", x);
  x++;
} while (x < 5);

In this example:
let x = 5: Initializes x to 5.
The do block executes once, printing "Do-while loop iteration: 5".
x++ increments x to 6.
while (x < 5): The condition 6 < 5 is false, so the loop terminates after the first execution.
