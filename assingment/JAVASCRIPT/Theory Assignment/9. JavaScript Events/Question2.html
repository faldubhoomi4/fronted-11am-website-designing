an example.

Answer: 

The addEventListener() method in JavaScript is used to attach an event handler to a specified element in the Document Object Model (DOM).
It allows you to execute a function when a particular event, such as a click, keypress, or mouseover, occurs on that element. 

 How it works:
    The addEventListener() method takes at least two arguments:
    event (string): The type of event to listen for (e.g., "click", "keydown", "submit"). 
    function (function): The function to be executed when the specified event occurs. This can be a named function or an anonymous function. 
    useCapture (boolean, optional): A boolean value that determines whether the event should be handled during the capturing phase (true) or the bubbling phase (false). The default value is false (bubbling). 
    When the specified event happens on the target element, the provided function (the event handler) is automatically called.



 Example:
    This example demonstrates how to use addEventListener() to display an alert when a button is clicked.
    Code

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>addEventListener Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

        <script>
            // Get a reference to the button element
            const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton');

            // Add a click event listener to the button
            myButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
                alert('Button was clicked!');
            });
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>



 In this example:
    document.getElementById('myButton') selects the HTML button with the ID "myButton".
    myButton.addEventListener('click', function() { ... }); attaches a "click" event listener to the myButton element.
    The anonymous function function() { alert('Button was clicked!'); } is the event handler. When the button is clicked, 
    this function is executed, and an alert box appears with the message "Button was clicked!".
