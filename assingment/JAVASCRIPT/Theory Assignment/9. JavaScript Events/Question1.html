<!-- Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners 
 Answer: 
    In JavaScript, an event is an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, 
    which the browser can detect and respond to.
     Events can be triggered by user interactions, browser activities, or programmatic actions.


Examples of Events:
    Event Type	                    Example Trigger
    Mouse Event                 	Clicking a button (click), moving the mouse (mousemove)
    Keyboard Event	                Pressing a key (keydown, keyup)
    Form Event	                    Submitting a form (submit), changing an input (change)
    Window Event	                Page load (load), resizing the window (resize)

 Role of Event Listeners

    An event listener is a method in JavaScript that waits for a specific event to occur on an HTML element and executes a function in response to that event.

    The primary role of event listeners:

    Detect user interactions like clicks, key presses, mouse movements, etc.

    Execute custom JavaScript code when these events happen.

    Make web pages interactive and dynamic.

Syntax of Event Listener

    element.addEventListener("event", function);

    element → The HTML element (like a button, input, etc.)

    event → Type of event (e.g., "click", "mouseover")

    function → The code to run when the event happens


Example: 

    const myButton = document.getElementById('myButton');

    myButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button was clicked!');
    });

 Explanation:

    The event listener waits for the click event on the button.

    When the user clicks the button, the function runs and shows an alert.

 Why Use Event Listeners?
    Keeps HTML and JavaScript separate (clean code).

    Allows multiple events on the same element.

    Makes code easier to maintain and reusable.
