 Question 1: What are components in React? Explain the difference between functional
components and class components

Q1: What are Components in React?

In React, a component is a reusable, independent piece of UI that can be rendered on the screen.

Think of components like building blocks of a React application.

Each component can have:

UI (View) → What is displayed (HTML/JSX)

Logic → How it behaves (state, props, event handling)


For example, a Button, Navbar, or UserCard can each be separate components.


React mainly has two types of components:

1. Functional Components

Written as JavaScript functions.

Receive props as arguments and return JSX.

Can use React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) for managing state and lifecycle.

Simpler, cleaner, and more commonly used in modern React.

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

2. Class Components

Written as ES6 classes.

Extend from React.Component.

Must use render() method to return JSX.

Can manage state and lifecycle using class methods (this.state, componentDidMount, etc.).

More verbose, less commonly used in modern React (replaced by hooks).

Example: 
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}


Key Differences:        Functional vs Class Components
Feature   	                Functional Components	                     Class Components
Syntax	                    JavaScript function	                       ES6 class extends React.Component
State	                Managed using Hooks (useState)	               Managed using this.state
Lifecycle Methods	Achieved with Hooks (useEffect)	                   Use methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate
Code Simplicity     	Concise & easier to read	                   Verbose, requires this keyword
Performance  	   Slightly better (before Hooks, they were stateless) 	Heavier due to class overhead
Modern Usage	Preferred in new projects	                            Legacy, still seen in old projects
