 Question 3: What is the role of render() in class components?
 
 What is the role of render() in class components?
ðŸ”¹ Definition:

In React class components, the render() method is a mandatory method.

It is responsible for describing what should be displayed on the UI.

The render() method must return JSX (or null).


Key Roles of render()

Defines the UI:

Determines what HTML/JSX will be shown when the component is rendered.

Uses props and state:

It can access this.props and this.state to dynamically render data.

Pure Function Concept:

render() should be a pure function, meaning:

It should only depend on props and state.

It should not modify state or interact with the DOM directly.

import React, { Component } from "react";

class Greeting extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { message: "Welcome to React!" };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
        <p>Hello, {this.props.name}!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Greeting;

If name="Bhoomi" is passed from parent:

Welcome to React!
Hello, Bhoomi!

Important Points

Every class component must have a render() method.

render() is called whenever:

The component first mounts (initial render).

The state or props change (re-render).

It should not contain side effects (like API calls, timers, or setState) â†’ those go inside lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.
