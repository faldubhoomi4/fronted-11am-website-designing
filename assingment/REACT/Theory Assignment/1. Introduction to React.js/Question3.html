Question 3: Discuss the importance of using curly braces {} in JSX expressions.



Advantages of Using React.js in Web Development:

Component-Based Architecture

    UIs are built from small, reusable pieces called components.

    Each component manages its own logic and UI, making code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.


Virtual DOM for High Performance

    React uses a Virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the page that change, instead of re-rendering the whole DOM.

    This makes applications faster and more responsive, especially for dynamic and interactive UIs.


Reusable & Maintainable Code

    Components can be reused across different parts of the application.

    This reduces redundancy and speeds up development time.

Declarative UI

    You describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React updates the DOM automatically.

    This makes code more predictable and easier to debug compared to imperative approaches.

Strong Community and Ecosystem

    Huge open-source community support with thousands of libraries, tools, and resources.

    Backed by Meta (Facebook), ensuring continuous updates and long-term support.

Cross-Platform Development

    With React Native, developers can use the same React knowledge to build mobile apps for iOS and Android.

    Code sharing between web and mobile projects improves productivity.

Rich Developer Tools

    React Developer Tools (browser extension) helps inspect component hierarchies, props, and state easily.

    Makes debugging and optimization more convenient.

SEO-Friendly

    With server-side rendering (e.g., using Next.js), React apps can be optimized for search engine visibility, 
    which is usually hard for JavaScript-heavy apps.

Flexibility

    React focuses only on the view layer, so developers can integrate it with other frameworks or libraries 
    (like Redux, Node.js, or Express).

    This gives developers freedom in choosing their tech stack.
