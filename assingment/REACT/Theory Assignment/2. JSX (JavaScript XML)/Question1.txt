 Question 1: What is JSX in React.js? Why is it used?

Answer: JSX stands for JavaScript XML, 
and it is a special syntax used in React to simplify building user interfaces. 
JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly inside JavaScript, 
enabling you to create UI components more efficiently.
Although JSX looks like regular HTML, it’s actually a syntax extension for JavaScript.


Example:

const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;

Behind the scenes, JSX gets transpiled by Babel into React.createElement() calls:

const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");

So JSX is not required, but it makes writing UI code much more readable and expressive.


2. Why is JSX used?:

JSX is used in React because:

 Readability – Makes code look like HTML, easier to understand and maintain.
 Combination of UI + Logic – You can write markup and JavaScript logic in one place.
 Dynamic content – Supports embedding JavaScript expressions using { }.
 Cleaner Code – Avoids manually calling React.createElement().
 Developer Productivity – Faster development with fewer errors.
