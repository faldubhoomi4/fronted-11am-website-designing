 ï‚· Question 2: Explain the concept of state in React and how it is used to manage component
data.
What is State in React?

    State is a built-in object in React that is used to hold data within a component.

    It represents dynamic values that can change over time, such as user input, form values, counters, or API data.

    When state changes, React re-renders the component automatically to reflect the new data on the UI.

How is State Used?

    In functional components, we manage state using the useState hook:

    import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  // count = current state value
  // setCount = function to update state
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}


ğŸ”¹ Explanation:

    useState(0) â†’ initializes state count with 0.

    setCount â†’ updates the state.

    When the button is clicked, React updates count and re-renders the component with the new value.

Key Points About State

    Mutable â†’ Unlike props, state can be changed by the component itself.

    Triggers Re-render â†’ Any state update causes the component (and its children, if affected) to re-render.

    Component-specific â†’ Each component manages its own state independently.

    Asynchronous updates â†’ State updates may be batched, so donâ€™t rely on immediate changes.

Real-life Example

    Imagine a light switch app:

    State = whether the light is ON or OFF.

    setState = the action of flipping the switch.

    When you flip it, the state changes â†’ UI updates (Light ON / Light OFF).
