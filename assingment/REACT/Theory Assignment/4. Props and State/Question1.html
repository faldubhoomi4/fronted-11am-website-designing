  Question 1: What are props in React.js? How are props different from state?
 
 Answer:
    Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.

    They allow data to flow one way (parent → child), making components reusable and dynamic.

    Example:
    function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
    }

    function App() {
    return <Greeting name="Bhoomi" />;
}
   Here, name="Bhoomi" is a prop passed to the Greeting component.

| Feature          | **Props**                                                    | **State**                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**   | Data passed from parent to child component                   | Data that a component manages internally                                  |
| **Mutability**   | **Immutable** (cannot be changed inside child component)     | **Mutable** (can be updated with `setState` or `useState`)                |
| **Who sets it?** | Parent component sets props                                  | Component itself manages its own state                                    |
| **Usage**        | Used to pass data into a component (like function arguments) | Used for data that changes over time (like user input, counters, toggles) |
| **Direction**    | Unidirectional (parent → child)                              | Fully contained within the component                                      |
| **Example**      | `<Greeting name="Alice" />`                                  | `const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`                                  |


In short:

Props = external, read-only data (like arguments).

State = internal, changeable data (like variables inside a function).
